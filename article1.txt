U.S.-brokered talks to extend the Gaza cease-fire stalled as Israel and Hamas remained divided over hostages, security guarantees, and the future governance of Gaza, while American diplomatic attention increasingly shifted toward negotiations over Ukraine.

Negotiators struggled to reconcile Hamas’s demands for guarantees on Gaza’s political future with Israel’s insistence on security control and the return of hostages. Officials cautioned that while talks continued, progress was fragile.
